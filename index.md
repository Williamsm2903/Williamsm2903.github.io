### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs. This lab is when I first started doing
    code.You were able to get into a terminal and actually type. It was fun to
    hear about how to code beforehand so with this lab you actually started and
    it sparked a fun experience for me.

* Lab 5 part 1

    Lab 5 part one was the lab where you got to make your own sandwich. In this
    lab you could type in the ingredients that you wanted on a sandwich and it 
    was relayed back to you.This lab was interesting because I feel like it was
    the first time seeing my work paying off in my code.

* Lab 6 part 2

    Lab 6 part 2 was the guessing game lab. In this lab you were able to play a game
    with the computer. This game it had you guess the number the computer picked.
    I enjoyed this one because it felt like the movie War Games.
